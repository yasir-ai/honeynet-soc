## üöÄ Introduction: Simulating Reality, Building Resilience

This project documents the creation and hardening of a scalable **honeynet** within the Microsoft Azure cloud ecosystem. The primary objective was to establish a controlled, observable environment to attract and analyze malicious activity, then implement robust security controls and measure their effectiveness.

By ingesting logs from diverse Azure resources into a central **Azure Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)**, and leveraging **Microsoft Sentinel** as our Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, we could:
1.  Detect and visualize attack patterns.
2.  Generate automated alerts and incidents for suspicious activities.
3.  Quantify security posture improvements using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.

This hands-on endeavor mirrors real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) practices, offering invaluable insights into threat detection, incident response, and the tangible impact of security hardening. The project spanned two distinct 24-hour phases: an initial "exposed" phase for baseline metrics, followed by a "hardened" phase to compare and contrast.

## Phase 1: Constructing the Honeynet - The "Open Gates" Approach

The initial phase focused on building the honeynet infrastructure with intentionally weakened security postures to maximize the observable attack surface. This approach, while risky in a production environment, is crucial for a honeynet's purpose: to attract and study attacks.

### üîë Key Setup Steps:
1.  **Virtual Machine Deployment:**
    *   Provisioned a **Windows Server VM** and installed **SQL Server**. The native Windows Firewall was **disabled**.
    *   Provisioned a **Linux VM**. Its firewall (e.g., `ufw`, `firewalld`) was also **disabled**.
    *   A dedicated **"Attack-VM"** was created within Azure to simulate controlled attacks from a known source, complementing organic internet traffic.
2.  **Network Configuration:**
    *   **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** were configured with "Allow Any/Any" inbound rules for protocols like RDP (3389), SSH (22), HTTP/S (80/443), and SQL (1433). This made the VMs globally accessible.
3.  **Identity & Access:**
    *   Multiple users were created in **Microsoft Entra ID** with varying permission levels, simulating potential internal account compromise scenarios.
4.  **Logging Infrastructure:**
    *   An **Azure Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)** was established as the central log sink.
    *   All relevant Azure resources (VMs, NSGs, Entra ID, Key Vault, etc.) were configured to forward their diagnostic logs and security events to this LAW.
5.  **Threat Intelligence & Monitoring Setup:**
    *   An **Azure Blob Storage** account was created to host an `IP-watchlist.csv` file, containing known malicious IP addresses. This was later integrated with Sentinel for threat correlation.
    *   **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** was enabled to provide baseline security recommendations and threat detection capabilities.
    *   An **Azure Key Vault** was provisioned, and sample "secrets" were created to monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
6.  **SIEM Configuration (Microsoft Sentinel):**
    *   Microsoft Sentinel was connected to the LAW.
    *   Several **custom analytic rules** were crafted in Sentinel to trigger alerts and create incidents for specific events, such as:
        *   Multiple failed login attempts (brute-force).
        *   Successful login after multiple failures.
        *   Access to Key Vault secrets from an unauthorized IP.
        *   Execution of suspicious commands or processes (if advanced VM logging was enabled).
        *   Matches against the `IP-watchlist`.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Before Hardening:
This diagram illustrates the initial, highly exposed state of the honeynet.

![Architecture BEFORE Hardening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8fdc64f-38e0-4a70-bbe3-99f5b81a1583)
*(All resources deployed with public endpoints and minimal network restrictions.)*

### üéØ Simulated Attacks During Open Exposure:
While the environment was open to organic internet traffic, the following specific attacks were simulated using the 'Attack-VM':
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** Multiple RDP/SSH login attempts with incorrect credentials against both Windows and Linux VMs, eventually culminating in a successful login with known credentials.
    *   *Real-world parallel: Attackers constantly scan for open RDP/SSH ports and attempt to brute-force weak credentials.*
*   **Simulated Malware Upload:** A benign file named to mimic malware (e.g., `mimikatz.exe`, `evil_script.sh`) was uploaded to a VM to test file integrity monitoring or endpoint detection rules (if configured).
    *   *Real-world parallel: Initial compromise often involves dropping malware or tools onto a victim machine.*
*   **Key Vault Access Violation:** An attempt was made to access secrets in Azure Key Vault using credentials or from an IP address that lacked sufficient permissions.
    *   *Real-world parallel: Attackers often seek out secrets (API keys, connection strings) to escalate privileges or pivot within a network.*

These simulated events were designed to ensure Sentinel's analytic rules were functioning correctly and generating the expected alerts and incidents.

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 2: Incident Response, Remediation, and Fortification

After 24 hours of data collection in the "open" state, the focus shifted to hardening the environment. This phase mirrors the remediation steps a SOC analyst would take after identifying vulnerabilities and active threats.

### üîç Analysis and Triage:
Logs in LAW were queried using KQL, and incidents in Sentinel were reviewed. As anticipated:
*   Brute-force attempts and the subsequent successful login triggered high-severity alerts.
*   The simulated malware upload and Key Vault access violations also generated corresponding alerts.
*   A significant amount of unsolicited traffic from various global IPs was observed, attempting to probe common ports.

### üîí Hardening Measures Implemented:
The following security controls were applied, guided by **Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations** and principles from the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **NIST SP 800-53**:

1.  **Firewall Re-activation & Configuration:**
    *   The built-in firewalls on both Windows (Windows Defender Firewall) and Linux (e.g., `ufw`) VMs were **re-enabled**.
    *   Rules were configured to **deny all inbound traffic by default**, only allowing specific necessary ports from trusted sources.
2.  **Network Security Group (NSG) Overhaul:**
    *   NSG rules were drastically tightened. Instead of "Allow Any/Any," rules were changed to **allow traffic only from my specific public IP address** for management (RDP/SSH).
    *   For inter-service communication within Azure, rules were restricted to specific Azure IP ranges or service tags.
3.  **Private Endpoints Implementation:**
    *   Public endpoints for Azure services like SQL Server (on the VM, conceptually), Blob Storage, and Key Vault were **disabled**.
    *   **Private Endpoints** were implemented, exposing these services only within the project's Virtual Network (VNet). This effectively removes them from the public internet.
    *   *This is a critical defense-in-depth measure, ensuring that even if an NSG rule was misconfigured, the service itself wouldn't be publicly accessible.*
4.  **Just-In-Time (JIT) VM Access (Recommended by Defender for Cloud):**
    *   While not explicitly stated as implemented in the original, enabling JIT access for RDP/SSH ports is a common and highly effective hardening step. It keeps ports closed until access is explicitly requested and approved for a limited time.
5.  **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Review:**
    *   User permissions in Entra ID were reviewed, adhering to the **principle of least privilege**. Unnecessary administrative roles were removed or scoped down.
6.  **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Recommendations:**
    *   Actively addressed alerts and recommendations provided by Defender for Cloud, such as enabling specific security features, patching vulnerabilities, or configuring adaptive application controls.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture After Hardening:
This diagram showcases the significantly improved security posture after implementing the controls.

![Architecture AFTER Hardening](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52173322-dae6-419c-b0d7-46237da9f193)
*(Resources are now shielded by restrictive NSGs, host firewalls, and utilize private endpoints, drastically reducing the attack surface.)*

## üìä Phase 3: Measuring the Impact - Metrics Before vs. After

Once the security controls were in place, the environment was monitored for another 24-hour period. The collected data was then compared against the baseline from the "open" phase.

### üìà Security Metrics Comparison (24hr periods):

| Metric Category                 | Before Hardening | After Hardening | Change (%) | Significance                                                                                                |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------: | :-------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Failed RDP/SSH Logins**       |      ~3500       |        0        |  -100%     | Drastic reduction due to NSG restrictions & firewall rules. Attackers can no longer reach the login ports. |
| **Security Alerts (Sentinel)**  |       ~50        |      ~2-5       |   ~-90%    | Significant drop; remaining alerts likely from internal "Attack-VM" tests or highly persistent (but blocked) probes. |
| **Malicious IPs Detected (NSG)**|      ~200        |      ~5-10      |   ~-95%    | NSGs block most unsolicited traffic before it can be analyzed deeper.                                     |
| **Successful Brute-Force**      |        1         |        0        |  -100%     | Hardened credentials and port restrictions prevent unauthorized access.                                     |
| **Key Vault Anomalous Access**  |        1         |        0        |  -100%     | Private endpoints and IAM controls prevent unauthorized access attempts.                                    |
